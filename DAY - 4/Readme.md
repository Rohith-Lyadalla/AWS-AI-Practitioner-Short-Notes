# 2.  Deep Learning (DL) Fundamentals
# 2.1 What is Machine Learning (ML)?
- ML is a subset of AI.
- It enables machines to learn from data and make predictions/decisions without explicit programming.
- Goal: Improve performance on tasks by learning patterns from examples.
# 2.2 What Problem Does ML Solve?
- ML allows computers to learn from data instead of following rigid rules.
- Helps in predictions, pattern recognition, decision-making, and automation.
# 2.3 Key Problems Solved by ML
- Pattern Recognition & Classification: e.g., spam email detection.
- Prediction: future outcomes like house prices or disease prognosis.
- Automation: repetitive tasks such as image labeling or translation.
- Personalization: recommendations based on user behavior.
- Complex Problem Solving: fraud detection, medical diagnosis, traffic optimization.
# 2.4 Features of ML
- Predictive Modeling: forecast unseen outcomes.
- Automation: reduces need for manual programming.
- Scalability: handles massive datasets efficiently.
- Generalization: applies patterns to new/unseen data.
- Adaptiveness: improves with new data over time.
- Dynamic Adaptation: continuously evolves in changing environments.
- Data Handling: detects patterns humans may miss.
# 2.5 Benefits of ML
- Automation of repetitive tasks.
- Improved decision-making from complex data.
- Pattern detection for predictions and personalization.
- Continuous improvement as it learns from new data.
- Scalability for big data applications.
- Cost efficiency by reducing errors and saving resources.
- Enhanced user experience via personalization and chatbots.
