# 1. Machine Learning (ML)
# 1.1 What is Machine Learning?
- ML teaches computers to **learn from data instead of following fixed instructions.**
- Works like guiding a child with examples rather than step-by-step rules.

**Examples:**
- Netflix recommends movies based on past viewing.
- Email filters spam automatically.

**Aim:** computers identify patterns and make decisions without explicit programming.
# 1.2 What is Deep Learning?
- An advanced **type of ML using neural networks inspired by the human brain.**
- Networks have many layers to process data more effectively.

**Strengths:**
- Face recognition.
- Speech understanding (Alexa/Siri).
- Language translation.

**Difference:**

**ML:** Learn from data to predict outcomes.

**Deep Learning:** Handles larger, more complex problems with layered models.
# 1.3 Datasets in Machine Learning
**Purpose**

**Training:** Teaches models relationships between inputs and outputs.

**Validation:** Tunes model settings during development.

**Testing:** Evaluates performance on new, unseen data.
# 1.3.1  Types of Data
**Structured:** Organized tables (sales data, student records).

**Unstructured:** No fixed format (text, images, audio).
# 1.3.2  Common Dataset Types
**Numerical:** Numbers (e.g., temperatures).

**Categorical:** Groups/labels (e.g., colors).

**Time series:** Sequential data over time (stock prices).

**Image/audio:** Recognition tasks (medical scans, speech).

# 1.3.3 Dataset Splits
**Training :** Learn patterns

**Validation :** Tune learning, avoid overfitting

**Testing :** Check performance on unseen data

# 1.3.4 Importance of Good Datasets

- Directly impacts model accuracy.
- Must be diverse, balanced, relevant, and well-labeled.

**Better datasets = models that generalize well in real-world tasks.**
# Points to be remembered:
- ML: Computers learn patterns from data.
- Deep Learning: Brain-inspired, layered networks for complex tasks.
- Datasets: Key for training, validation, and testing.
- Quality data = Better learning and generalization.
- Good datasets are structured collections that empower ML models to solve real-world problems.
