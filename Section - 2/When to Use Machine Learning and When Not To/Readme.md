# 9. When to Use Machine Learning and When Not To: A Complete Guide
# 9.1 When to Use Machine Learning
- **Rule-based coding is hard:** Use ML when coding precise rules is complex (e.g., spam filtering with many overlapping factors).
- **Large-scale tasks:** ML is efficient at processing huge volumes of data where manual methods fail.
- **Learning patterns:** ML excels when the problem requires finding patterns in data rather than applying static instructions.
# Tips for deciding
- If **rules can’t be clearly defined, ML may help.**
- If scale or data complexity is beyond manual processing, ML is appropriate.
# Alternative Approaches
- If the **target value can be computed exactly using simple rules or formulas, skip ML.**
- Direct **coding avoids approximation errors** and **gives precise results.**
- Evaluate **task requirements—choose the simplest effective method.**
# 9.2 When NOT to Use Machine Learning
- **Deterministic problems:** If the outcome can be calculated exactly (e.g., card probability problems), code it directly.
- **Avoid unnecessary ML:** ML gives approximate answers and may introduce errors.
- **Prefer exact computation:** Well-defined, small problems don’t need complex ML setups.
- **Large language models** can reason better now, but they **still can’t guarantee perfect deterministic answers.**
# Points to be remembered:
- Use ML for complex, large-scale, pattern-based problems where rules are hard to define.
- Avoid ML for simple, exact, deterministic problems—use direct coding instead.
- Always match the approach to the problem’s complexity and scale.
