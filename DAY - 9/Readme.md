# 7. Pricing factors
**1. Speed and Reliability**
- Higher speed and uptime cost more.
- Slower responses and occasional downtime save money.

**2. Backup and Redundancy**
- Data can be stored in multiple locations for safety.
- More copies = higher costs.
- Spreading across regions or countries increases expenses further.

**3. Computing Power**
- CPU: Cheapest, slower (basic option).
- GPU: Faster, more expensive (boosts AI performance).
- Custom hardware: Very fast, very costly (for specialized needs).

**4. Token-Based Pricing**
- Costs depend on the number of tokens (3–4 characters each).
- You pay for both input (to the AI) and output (from the AI).
- Works like a pay-as-you-go system.

**5. Provisioned Throughput**
- Reserve fixed processing power (like booking a table).
- Pay hourly even if not fully used.
- Useful for predictable, high usage workloads.

**6. Custom AI Models**
- Pre-built models: Cheaper, ready to use.
- Custom models: Costlier, need more training and resources.

# Points to be remembered:
- Speed & Reliability: Faster service = higher cost.
- Redundancy: Extra copies improve safety but raise prices.
- Computing Power: CPU (cheap) → GPU (faster) → Custom hardware (fastest + expensive).
- Token Pricing: Pay per character for input/output.
- Provisioned Throughput: Guaranteed performance at a fixed rate.
- Custom Models: Ready-made = cheaper, custom = pricier and resource-heavy.
