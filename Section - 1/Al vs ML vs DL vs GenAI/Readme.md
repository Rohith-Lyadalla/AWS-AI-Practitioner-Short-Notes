# 5. Relationship Between Al, ML, DL, and GenAI
# 5.1 Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- **AI is the broadest concept** any technique that **mimics human intelligence.**
- Includes **reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making.**
- Covers both **basic rule-based systems and advanced cognitive models.**
# 5.2 Machine Learning (ML)
- **Subsets of AI focused on learning patterns from data.**
- **Improves performance without explicit programming.**
- **Used for prediction and classification.**
- Relies on examples to **generalize learning.**
- **Involves reasoning for better decision-making.**
# 5.3 Deep Learning (DL)
- **Specialized subset of ML.**
- Uses **multi-layered neural networks (deep neural networks).**
- Learns **complex patterns from large, unstructured data (images, audio, text).**
- **Power applications** like speech recognition and autonomous driving.
- **Focused on problem-solving through learned patterns.**
# 5.4 Generative AI (GenAI)
- **Subset of Deep Learning.**
- Focused on **creating new content (text, images, music, code, video).**
 - **Learn underlying patterns of existing data.**
- Goes beyond **analysis/classification → generates original outputs.**
- **Examples:** ChatGPT, DALL·E.
 -**Enables creativity and content generation.**
# Points to be remembered:
- **AI:** Broadest field that  mimics intelligence (reasoning, problem-solving).
- **ML:** Subset of AI that  learns patterns from data, improves predictions.
- **DL:** Subset of ML that  deep neural networks for complex, unstructured data.
- **GenAI:** Subset of DL that generates new, creative outputs like text & images.
